# Employee Expenses Frontend 

## Info

This service is also known as *Claim for your work uniform and tools*

This service allows an individual to update their tax accounts flat rate expense,
specifically that of their 56 IABD code relating to uniform and tool expenses.

Half of this service is unauthenticated, asking a number of eligibility questions to ensure a user is able to claim before passing them through to GG for sign in and completion.

This service does not have it's own backend for updating NPS, instead it uses TAI for this integration.
